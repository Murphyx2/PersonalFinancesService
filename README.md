# Personal Finances Service

The Personal Finances Service is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot to help users manage their personal finances. It allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete financial transactions, categorize them, and generate financial reports. The application uses a layered architecture (controller, service, repository) and integrates with a database for persistent storage.
### Features

    - Create and manage financial transactions (income and expenses).
    - Categorize transactions for better organization.
    - Retrieve transactions by ID or fetch all transactions.
    - Generate financial reports summarizing income, expenses, and balance.
    - Delete transactions as needed.

## Installation
### Prerequisites

    - Java 17 or higher
    - Maven (for dependency management and building)
    - Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or H2 for testing)
    - Git (to clone the repository)
    - Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Setup
1. Clone the Repository:    

        git clone https://github.com/Murphyx2/PersonalFinancesService.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

       cd PersonalFinancesService

3. Configure the Database:

- Edit src/main/resources/application.properties to set up your database. Example for PostgreSQL:

    #### properties

            spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/finances
            spring.datasource.username=your_username
            spring.datasource.password=your_password
            spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update            

4. Build the Project:

        mvn clean install
    
5. Run the Application:
    
        mvn spring-boot:run

The API will be available at http://localhost:8080 (or the port specified in application.properties).

### Usage

Interact with the API using tools like Postman, cURL, or any HTTP client. The API uses JSON for request and response bodies.
Example: Creating a Transaction

#### Create a new transaction by sending a POST request:

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/transactions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "amount": 100.00,
      "description": "Grocery Shopping",
      "category": "Expenses",
      "date": "2025-04-30"
    }'

#### Response:    
    {
      "id": 1,
      "amount": 100.00,
      "description": "Grocery Shopping",
      "category": "Expenses",
      "date": "2025-04-30"
    }
